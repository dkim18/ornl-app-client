# Getting Started

This project is another sample code with some dynamic aspects via JavaScript/other framework(my choice is React.js.) and this client side web application dynamically interacts with the first code sample and displays the growth chart with different percentile based on user input. This web application also demostrates rendering the right compoments during creating, updating and deleting of child record instead of reloading entire page.


I also have deployed this web application on github:<br>
<a href="https://dkim18.github.io/growth-chart-client/">https://dkim18.github.io/growth-chart-client/</a>


This sample demonstrates:
* Dynamic and responsive user interaction with the first code sample and display the growth chart based on user input
* Use of React for creating user interface
* Use of Note Package Manager
* Testing React Hooks with Enzyme and React Testing library (rendering and displaying initial children table)
* Deploying React in Github
* Use of Git for version control
* Use of JSDoc for documentation in React
* Use of READMEs for out of source docs
